 answer for what is 5 in this command |:grid_search = GridSearchCV(svc, param_grid, cv=5)
 means 5-fold cross-validation.

What does cv=5 mean?

It means the training data is split into 5 equal parts (folds).

How it works:

Split training data into 5 folds

Train the model on 4 folds

Validate on 1 fold

Repeat this 5 times, each time using a different fold for validation

Average the results

Why do we do this?

To get a more reliable estimate of model performance

To reduce the risk of overfitting

To select C and gamma based on stable results, not luck

-----------
Why 5 specifically?

5 or 10 are industry standards

Good balance between:

Accuracy of evaluation

Computation time

Important note (AI Engineer mindset)

cv=1 → meaningless

cv=2 → unstable

cv=5 → solid default

cv=10 → more accurate, slower
cv=5 means: “Try each parameter setting 5 times on different data splits and average the result.”

in this command grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
i know that :
What you should NEVER pass

❌ X_test, y_test
❌ X_train_scaled, y_test
❌ X_test_scaled, y_train

These break the learning logic.

One-line summary

You can use X_train, y_train

You should use X_train_scaled, y_train

You must not use test data in .fit()
