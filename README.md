Step 1
Define the product scope

Define what the system does, who it's for, what problems it solves, and what the MVP looks like. Identify user stories: "as a developer, I want to ask questions about this codebase in plain English."

Product thinking
User stories
Markdown / docs
------------------------

Step 2
Design the architecture

Design the full system: code ingestion pipeline → chunking → vector storage → LLM query layer → API → frontend. Define data flow, component boundaries, and storage strategy.

System design
ASP.NET Core
REST API
Vector DB design
Draw.io / diagrams

------------------------

Step 3
Build the code ingestion & parsing layer

Read source files from a repository, parse them into structured units (classes, methods, functions) using AST parsing, then chunk them semantically for LLM processing.

C# / .NET
Roslyn (C# AST)
Tree-sitter
Python
Semantic chunking
Git integration

------------------------

Step 4 — new
Build & fine-tune your own LLM

Train or fine-tune a small language model on code-specific data to improve accuracy for your use case. This is advanced — most products skip this and use an existing LLM API instead. Fine-tuning makes sense once you have real usage data.

Python
PyTorch / HuggingFace
LoRA fine-tuning
Training datasets
GPU compute
Transformers

------------------------


Step 5
Integrate the AI layer

Connect the parsed, chunked code to an LLM. Send relevant chunks as context with each query. Implement the RAG pipeline: embed chunks → store in vector DB → retrieve by similarity → pass to LLM with a prompt.

Claude API / OpenAI API
RAG pipeline
Embeddings
Prompt engineering
LangChain / custom

------------------------


Step 6
Build the intelligence features

Build the actual product features on top of the AI layer: natural language Q&A about the codebase, automatic bug detection, code documentation generation, dependency analysis, and code explanation.

LLM APIs
Prompt design
C# / ASP.NET Core
Feature engineering

------------------------


Step 7
Build the backend API

Expose all features through a clean REST API. Handle authentication, rate limiting, multi-tenant support (for SaaS), and codebase management endpoints.

ASP.NET Core
REST API
JWT auth
SQL Server
Multi-tenancy
Swagger

------------------------


Step 8
Build a basic frontend / interface

A simple web UI for users to upload their codebase, ask questions, and view results. Doesn't need to be complex — the core value is in the AI layer.

JavaScript
HTML / CSS
React (optional)
REST API calls

------------------------


Step 9
Testing, evaluation & quality

Test the system end-to-end. Evaluate LLM response quality (accuracy, relevance, hallucination rate). Write automated tests for the backend API and ingestion pipeline.

Python
Robot Framework
LLM evaluation
Unit testing
xUnit / NUnit

------------------------


Step 10
Deployment & DevOps

Deploy the system to cloud infrastructure. Set up CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling for the vector search and LLM query layers.

Docker
Azure / AWS
CI/CD
GitHub Actions
Logging / monitoring

------------------------


Step 11
Productization & monetization

Turn it into a real SaaS product: pricing tiers, subscription billing, onboarding flow, usage limits, and a landing page. This is what separates a project from a product.

Stripe (billing)
SaaS architecture
Landing page
Analytics
User onboarding
